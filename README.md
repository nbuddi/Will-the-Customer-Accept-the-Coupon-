Assignment 5.1 : Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?


Findings Summary: Bar Coupon Acceptance
	This document summarizes key findings regarding the acceptance of bar coupons, identifying the primary demographics most receptive to these offers.


Key Insights:
	High Propensity Among Frequent Bar-Goers: 
		There is a strong and consistent trend indicating that drivers who frequent bars more often (more than 3 times a month, or even more than once a month) are significantly more likely to accept bar coupons. This segment represents the core target audience.
	Age's Role for Regulars: 
		Among individuals who visit bars more than once a month, those over the age of 25 exhibit a higher coupon acceptance rate. This suggests that the coupons resonate more with slightly older bar-goers, potentially due to factors like increased disposable income or differing social habits.
	"Urban/Social" Lifestyle Correlation: 
		A notably high acceptance rate is observed among drivers who meet the following criteria: go to bars more than once a month, have non-kid passengers, and are employed in occupations outside of farming, fishing, or forestry. This profile strongly suggests a correlation with a more "urban" or "social" lifestyle, where bar-going is common and individuals likely have more discretionary time and income. The presence of "non-kid passengers" further reinforces this adult-oriented, social context.
	Receptiveness of Younger Bar-Goers: 
		Even younger bar-goers, specifically those under 30 who frequent bars more than once a month, demonstrate a receptive attitude towards these coupons. This indicates that age, within this specific context, does not diminish their likelihood of acceptance.
	Opportunity with Budget-Conscious Individuals: 
		An interesting secondary group for coupon targeting includes drivers who frequent "cheap restaurants" more than four times a month and have an income less than $50,000. This suggests that individuals who are more budget-conscious or have lower incomes are also good candidates, possibly because the coupons offer a perceived financial saving. This highlights the importance of the coupon's value proposition for this demographic.


Conclusion:
	The most compelling finding is that regular bar-goers, particularly those leading a social, adult-oriented, and potentially urban lifestyle, are the prime demographic for accepting bar coupons. 
	Additionally, there is a promising secondary audience comprising younger frequent bar-goers and individuals who are more budget-conscious. These insights provide a strong foundation for targeted marketing strategies for bar coupon campaigns.
